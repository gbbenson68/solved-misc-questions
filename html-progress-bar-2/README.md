# Update Progress Bar 2

This is a simple demonstration of a ```<progress>``` element in HTML5. This was
given to me as a test question, which I totally botched because I'd forgotten most
of my vanilla JavaScript.

Unlike the test question, I embedded an element in ```index.html```, rather than
generating it on the fly with vanila JavaScript.
