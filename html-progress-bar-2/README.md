# Update Progress Bar 2

This is a simple demonstration of a ```<progress>``` element in HTML5. This was given to me as a test question, which I totally botched because I'd forgotten most of my vanilla JavaScript.

Unlike the test question, I embedded an element in ```index.html```, rather than generating it on the fly with vanila JavaScript.

Find more information on the HTML5 ```<progress>``` element [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress).

#### To run this demo
1.  Fork and clone this repository.
2.  Navigate your browser to the location of the ```index.html``` file of local, cloned repository:

    ```
    file:///absolute/path/to/your/local/index.html
    ```
