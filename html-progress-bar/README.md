# Update Progress Bar

This is a simple demonstration of a ```<progress>``` element in HTML5. This was given to me as a test question, which I totally botched because I'd forgotten most of my vanilla JavaScript.

The ```<progress>``` is both generated and updated on the fly with vanila JavaScript.

Find more information on the HTML5 ```<progress>``` element [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress).

#### To run this demo
This demo does not require any HTML file to run - just simply copy and paste the entire contents of the ```updateProgressBar.js``` file to your browser's console to execute.

_NOTE: On Firefox browsers you will need to enter_ ```allow pasting``` _into the console window._
